# Inset.js

[![Standard JavaScript Style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://standardjs.com/)

Inset shadows for HTML's `<canvas>` element.

Currently supports inset shadows on shapes draw with `fillRect`, or shapes draw using the path functions (`beginPath`, `moveTo`, `lineTo`, `arc`, `arcTo`, etc.) and then `fill`.

## Usage

Inset was developed with a modern JavaScript workflow in mind. To use it, it's recommended you have a build system in place that can transpile ES6, and bundle modules. For a minimal boilerplate that does so, check out [outset](https://github.com/callmecavs/outset).

### Install

Using NPM, install inset.js, and add it to your package.json dependencies.

```bash
npm install inset.js --save
```
<!--Refer to the releases page for version specific information.-->

### Import

Import Inset. Do not bind any variables, as Inset does all its work in the background and does not export anything.

```javascript
import 'inset.js'
```


### Inset!

Simply set 

```javascript
ctx.shadowInset = true;
```

and then draw a shape as you normally would. For example:

```javascript
var c = document.getElementById('canvas');
var ctx = c.getContext('2d');

ctx.shadowInset = true;
ctx.shadowBlur = 15;
ctx.shadowColor = 'black';

ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, c.width, c.height);
```

## Testing

Tests are performed using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), along with a little help from the excellent [imagediff](https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/js-imagediff) library. Since this project relies on the browser-based `Canvas` API, tests are run in a browser-like environment.

To run tests locally, first clone this repo and install all the necessary NPM packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patlillis/inset.js
cd inset.js
npm install
```

<!--
### Command line

Command line tests are performed using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (hooked into Mocha with [phantom-js-core](https://github.com/nathanboktae/mocha-phantomjs-core)). Once you have run `npm install`, it should be as simple as

```bash
npm run test
```

Test results will be displayed in the terminal.
-->
### Manual

Currently, the only way to perform tests is in an actual full browser (support for PhantomJS is in the works). To perform the tests yourself manually in a browser, run

```bash
npm run test
```

Test results will be displayed in a lovely interactive UI using Mocha's [HTML](https://mochajs.org/#html) reporter. As a bonus, it will also display image diffs of all Canvas tests.
